# Withdraw TTKO/TTKOe balance

This guide is for users who:

- Want to withdraw remaining TTKO tokens after proposing a block.
- Want to withdraw TTKO rewards for proving a block.

## Prerequisites

- Must have a balance of Sepolia ETH (if withdrawing TTKO) or Grimsvotn ETH (if withdrawing TTKOe) (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>

### Enter withdraw amount

Switch to the contract write page and select `withdrawTaikoToken(amount uint256)` to withdraw [TTKO](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6375394335f34848b850114b66A49D6F47f2cdA8#writeProxyContract#F11)/[TTKOe](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/address/0x4e7c942D51d977459108bA497FDc71ae0Fc54a00/write-proxy#address-tabs) balance.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to click the plus sign and add `10^8` decimals, or add 8 zeroes
  manually.
</Callout>

For example if you want to withdraw `69` TTKO, you would enter `6900000000`.

<Callout type="warning">

Make sure that you have enough balance of TTKO/TTKOe for the amount you are withdrawing, or the transaction will revert. You can check your balance with the `getTaikoTokenBalance()` function.
