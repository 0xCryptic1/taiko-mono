### Enter withdraw amount

Switch to the contract write page and select `withdrawTaikoToken(amount uint256)` to withdraw [TTKO](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6375394335f34848b850114b66A49D6F47f2cdA8#writeProxyContract#F11)/[TTKOe](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/address/0x4e7c942D51d977459108bA497FDc71ae0Fc54a00/write-proxy#address-tabs) TTKO balance.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to click the plus sign and add `10^8` decimals, or add 8 zeroes
  manually.

For example if you want to withdraw `69` TTKO, you would enter `6900000000`.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure
```solidity
amount<=getTaikoTokenBalance(proverAddress)
```
or else the transaction will revert.
